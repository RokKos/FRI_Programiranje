## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [rk7344@student.uni-lj.si](mailto:rk7344@student.uni-lj.si).

## Contributing Test Cases
I will be very glad if someone contributed test cases. They can even be the most simple ones, because with more tests more mistakes can be found.
Please try to verify your every test case if that's a possibility (on big test cases this is almost impossible).

### Format of Test Cases
Test case should consist of vhodXX.txt and izhodXX.txt, where XX is the number of test case. Please check that number of test case doesn't exist already.

### Sending Test Cases
You can fork this repository. All instructions are [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ "Fork A Repo"). Then:

1. Create and commit your test cases to your forked repository
2. Create pull request to this repository
3. I will look at the test cases and approve or propose to fix to your test case.
4. I will pull your pull request to this repository

The other option is to send me e-mail with zipped test cases on e-mail: rk7344@student.uni-lj.si with subject: Test cases for DNxx.
And I will manualy include them into this repository.

## Reporting Bad Test Cases
If you find a test case with wrong input data or wrong output data (result). Create issue with name DNxx Test case yy and then add description of the problem. The [template](https://github.com/RokKos/FRI_Programiranje/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md "Issue template") will tell you how the issue should be structured.
Or you can send me an e-mail with subject DNxx Test case yy.
